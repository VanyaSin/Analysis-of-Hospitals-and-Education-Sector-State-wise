Here, in this project I have tried to analyse the number of hospitals state wise and also education levels by population per lakh.
I have used libraries like pandas,matplotlib,seaborn,plotly. I have explicitly cleaned the data and made sure that it is free of noise like missing values and duplicate values.
This analysis helps us understand the disparities that might be created in states due to lack of health and educational facilities. Thus it can help us to rectify and make possible policy changes accordingly.
